Cotton growers in west Texas faces numerous challenges, from climate fluctuations such as extreme temperatures and droughts to diminishing groundwater reservoirs. This project is a collaborative citizen science initiative between growers and scientiest at Texas Tech University, aimed at addressing these challenges. 
In this on-field research porject, we studied how different regenerative soil management practices can help to maintain the soil health by improving soil moisture, temperature, carbon sequestration and soil microbial communities. Its purpose is to equip the growers, and consultants, and other stakeholders in the southern High Plains with a deeper comprehension of regenerative techniques that bolster soil resilience against climate adversities.
